# SIMS-API Documentation

##### Learn how to use the API and its ressource to keep track of the use of open data in Sweden. This API is provided by DIGG and the group 7 of the SIMS project from the Mittuniversitetet.
###### This document describes the resources that are part of the SIMS api.


## Schema

The API can be accessed via HTTPS from `https://localhost:7076/swagger/index.html`. All data is transfered as JSON format.

Instead of omitting blank attributes, they are included as blank.

## HTTP verbs

This API use HTTP verbs for each action in order to be considered a REST API. 

| HTTP Verb |         Description         |
|-----------|-----------------------------|
| `GET`     | Used for obtaining resources|
| `POST`    | Used for creating resources |
| `PUT`     | Used for updating resources |
| `DELETE`  | Used for removing resources |

Currently, only three of those HTTP verbs can be used: `GET`, `PUT`and `POST`.
Concerning the `DELETE`method, it is under development and this feature will be added soon.

A user can now:
* Get all resources
* Get a resource by its identifier
* Post a resource
* Update a resource

Additionnally, an user will be able to:
* Delete a resource

## Resources

To this version of the API, ten different resources are available to access. Accessing the base url, `https://localhost:7076/api/`, followed by the endpoint in your web browser will get you all instances of the resource you are looking for.
